# Virtual Pet Console Application

## Overview
This console application simulates caring for a virtual pet. It allows users to interact with the pet by feeding, playing, and resting. The pet's stats, including hunger, happiness, and health, are displayed and can be monitored by the user. 

## Features
1. **Pet Creation:**
   - Users can choose a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit) and give it a name.
   - A welcome message includes the pet's type and name.

2. **Pet Care Actions:**
   - Feeding: Decreases hunger, slightly increases health.
   - Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
   - Resting: Improves health, decreases happiness slightly.
   - Each action modifies the pet's stats accordingly and displays a message describing the action's effect.

3. **Pet Status Monitoring:**
   - Tracks and displays petâ€™s stats: hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
   - Implements a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.

4. **Enhanced Interaction Logic:**
   - Implements consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
   - Includes special messages or events based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if too hungry).

## Usage
